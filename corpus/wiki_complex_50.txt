Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown color , which comes from dissolved peat tannins .
In general the low fertility and cool climate results in relatively slow plant growth , but decay is even slower owing to the saturated soil .
It is one of the four main types of wetlands .
Bogs have distinctive assemblages of plant and animal species and are of high importance for biodiversity , particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed .
Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients .
Large areas of landscape can be covered many metres deep in peat .
They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat .
The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink .
Other names for bogs include mire , quagmire and muskeg ; alkaline mires are called fens .
Hence peat accumulates .
A bog is a mire that accumulates peat , a deposit of dead plant material-often mosses , and in a majority of cases , sphagnum moss .
